## Abstract

**Abstract Validator** (``AVal``) is a class implemented in Python, capable 
of taking a list of specific validation strategies (with parameters), as well 
as a method for handling exceptional situations, and applying these methods to 
the validation object. The **Abstract Validator** can be used by calling the 
validation **method** on an instance of a class, as well as a **decorator**.
